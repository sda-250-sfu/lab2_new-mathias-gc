    "# Lab 2 - Data Types, String/File Processing, Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second lab we will be looking at some of the more important skills needed to do text analysis. In order to start doing text analysis you first need to have text to analyze. This text will be stored in various data types. In the last lab you already saw two data types: int(for storing whole numbers) and strings. In this lab we will look at other important data types needed to do text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will look at string and file processing. We will learn how to read data to and from text files, how to store the data in data types such as strings and lists. And then we will do string processing on this data that is now stored in a string or list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly one of the most important things is file encodings. Computers store data as 0s and 1s so in order to read a text file we need to convert those 0s and 1s to letters. This is done using an encoding scheme. The problem is that there are lots of encoding schemes and different ones are used all the time. Some of the more common ones are utf-8 and utf-16 as well as latin1. So whenever you open a text file you need to make sure you are using the correct encoding scheme.\n",

    "### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Data types are one of the basic building blocks of your code. As mentioned earlier, data types are used to store information which we can then work with in various ways. In python the data type is automatically determined when you first assign a value to a variable. So when we assigned the number '18' to the variable 'age' in the last lab, the variable 'age' was turned into an integer data type.\n",
